I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The method isPieceValid() in class Pieces.
* The method prune() in class Help.
* The method rearrange() in class Help.

I choose those three methods as my best code since they improved
the speed of getting solutions.

isPieceValid() would check whether the piece is placed at the right place
, since only piece B and E are special, they can be placed at the boundary of the board if you put it properly. 
 In this way, I could eliminate a large amount of incorrect placement.

prune() is according the principle I found: only the ring at the second layer could be placed on the  noPensLocation.
So if there is a ring at noPensLocation, it must at second layer and there can't be any other rings be placed around it.

rearrange(): Since most pieces can't be placed at boundary, I put the boundary positions as the last of the possible positions.
In this way, the program would check the position with high posiblity first to find solutions more quickly.

I declare that this is entirely my own work
