I declare that the work I have submitted for Stage D of this assignment and all stages before it is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

The idea of <how to determine the position of Peg> came from a discussion with <Teammates>

The code in class <getChildren()> uses an idea suggested by <the lecture of Steve>
